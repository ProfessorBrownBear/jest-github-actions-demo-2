# DevOps CI/CD Pipeline Project

## Project Overview

This project is a hands-on exercise designed to teach students how to implement and maintain a DevOps pipeline using GitHub Actions, Jest, and Docker. It simulates real-world DevOps practices, including automated testing, issue tracking, and containerized deployments. By completing this project, students gain valuable experience in modern software development workflows and continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) practices.

## Objectives

1. **Set Up and Configure CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Use GitHub Actions to automate build and deployment processes.
   - Include triggers for push/pull requests, Jest tests, and Docker builds.

2. **Implement Jest Testing Framework**:
   - Write and automate test cases for a TypeScript application.
   - Use a traceability matrix to align tests with project features.

3. **Manage and Resolve GitHub Issues**:
   - Process and document issue resolutions.
   - Track progress with Agile workflows.

4. **Deploy with Docker**:
   - Create a Dockerfile for the application.
   - Automate the creation and deployment of Docker images.

5. **Document and Report**:
   - Maintain clear technical and process documentation.
   - Submit a final report summarizing the pipeline, testing, and lessons learned.

## Key Features

- **Pipeline Configuration**:
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file to define CI/CD workflows.
  - Automated builds, tests, and deployments.

- **Testing**:
  - Comprehensive Jest test suite integrated into the pipeline.
  - Automated test execution for TypeScript applications.

- **Containerization**:
  - Dockerfile to package the application for deployment.
  - Integrated Docker build and deployment steps.

- **Issue Tracking and Agile Practices**:
  - Use GitHub Issues to simulate real-world product management.
  - Continuous engagement through daily/weekly Agile tasks.

- **Documentation and Analytics**:
  - Up-to-date README.md and technical documentation.
  - Traceability matrix and issue resolution workflows.
  - Power BI dashboards for analytics.

## Deliverables

1. **GitHub Repository**:
   - CI/CD pipeline configuration.
   - Jest test suite and traceability matrix.
   - Dockerfile and containerization setup.

2. **Documentation Package**:
   - Technical and process documentation.
   - Issue management logs and code review records.
   - Updated traceability matrix.

3. **Final Report**:
   - Pipeline implementation details.
   - Analytics and lessons learned.
   - Recommendations for improvement.
